- 👋 Hi, I’m @ijustloveflexin 💪 I am a creator, author, business owner, energy healer,  and truth seeker
- 👀 I’m interested IN SAVING THE WORLD 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to solve global issues through utilyzing government resources, generative ai, and social media to ensure world peace for our generation by carving out a clear path. You have to know where you're going before you can get there and there's always multiple routes you can take and different philosopical ideals you might decide to adopt. Throughout history, humans have built civilizations only to tear it down again in an act of haste during some argument usually over a technicality or misunderstanding. Because of this, it has made it difficult to  know the truth about our origins or the reason we're here because the winner tells the story, leaving room for future generations to debate. Once again, no one wins. Is it the debate leading man to his detriment? Existensialism and the frustration of having to choose a side has been used as a tool for people of influence to manipulate and control the masses. Religious beliefs were never supposed to be a tool - to persuade, keep the masses in line, or to divide and conquor. The Bible was written and upheld through generations to maintain a standard of living that would be best for everyone involved. Every civilazation has their own interpretation of the same story and our ancestors obviously thought it was important to preserve our heritage and basic constructs our reality is founded upon.
- Unfortunatly, the traditional systematic beliefs and academic definitions that gave assurance to past civilazions simply do not suffice to certain groups in today's society. Athiests might call this a convenient; otherwise they would have to acknowledge the spiritual battle going on in their own lives.
- Growing up, the battle of good and evil always brought to mind God, the old man with a kind eyes and long beard fighting the devil who is portrayed as a ghastly fiend.  Both them and their comrades are emersed in a free-for-all battle where each blow has a significant impact on all forms of life. It is a constant power struggle  where the humanities fate and the cosmos itself is left in a state of uncertaintity and confusion.  But what if the battle of good and evil isn't just outside forces affecting our daily lives, in an attempt to win our souls?

- My friends Yin and Yang☯

I love this symbol because it represents balance. The angel on one shoulder & the devil on the other is a popular illustration. Most people forget the point because they get lost in their own opinions of right & wrong. This is just a depiction of the duality that we see so many examples of in the world and inside of ourselves.

There has to be a delicate balance between the two and it's important to remember the essential purpose of the yin AND the yang, respectively. We must be open-minded enough to look at it from an unbiased perspective and fully understand that there would be no such thing as good or bad without a means of comparison.

These are part of who we are.

Here is my theory: The devil is not a physical being who rules the underworld. It's simply the things that hold us back in life. Fear, worry, jealousy, self-doubt, and guilt are all examples of self-imposed limitations that hold us back from being who we were meant to be.

This would mean that Evil is something we see in our reality as a result of fearing the unknown, worrying about what the future holds, being jealous of others, and doubting ourselves. So essentially, hell is a state of mind.

It would also mean that the devil is God's alter-ego.
the devil is god's alter-ego as a part of the law of ONE concept that defines reality. Regardless of the personal beliefs we hold as indivuals, there are undeniable truths to the law of ONE. We experience life as a singluar part of the universal consciousness; this suggests that separateness is an illusion. IDK about you but I like it like that.

- 📫 How to reach me 3364484522 
- ⚡ Fun fact: i'm God and my goal is to show people in the the world today that it is totally possible to live the life of their dreams 
- ☮☮ the project i just posted is aligned with the BEST CASE SCENARIO TIMELINE - the only alternative to the timeline leading up to WWIII  
- 👍 Strengths:
-         1.) Seeing the highest potential of individuals, demonstrating empathy, forgiveness, and unconditional love without crossing boundaries, moral standards,  and universal laws
          2.) Open-minded conversationalist that knows what it means to create a safe space for people to discuss diverse topics; arguments are necessary to promote individuality and ensure every aspect in our society is built upon a strong foundation ensuring fairness and transparency for all who are involved.
          3.) My aura gives off good vibes; I can sense when people are experiencing greif or depression and I try to encourage them any way I can.
      
- 👎 Weaknesses:
-        1.) I tend to over-compensate & want to prove myself. I want people to know I'm straight-up even after it's understood 
         2.) Social anxiety - I'm working on this so I can do a TED talk one day 
         3.) I don't know everything, I was born in 1988 and have had to learn everything I know the hard way. When I was growing up I was stubborn and headstrong. Any advice given went through one ear and out the other but nowadays I'm grateful when someone gives me constructive critism because I don't always know what people are thinking. I find myself guessing in some situations when people are hard to read. The man I'm married to is mysterious to me. The fact that I can't figure him out makes him that much more interesting.

    🧗‍♀️ We're all on our own path trying to make the best of the cards we were dealt.
